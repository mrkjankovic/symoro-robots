SYMORO Robots
=============

This repository contains the parameters for different robots. Each
robot's parameters are placed in an individual folder under the robot's
name. 

The `*.par` files specify the robot parameters - geometric and dynamic.
All the parameters required to model a robot symbolically using SYMORO
or otherwise are specified in the `*.par` file. It should be noted that
`*.par` files are plain text files and can be opened by any text editor.

The other text files (`*.txt`) depending on the filename suffix (usually
the last three or four characters) appended to the robot name by an
underscore character provide the various models and equations that were
computed by the SYMORO software and stored for future reference.
